          The interactionist approach to
language acquisition refers to the
idea that language is acquired
through an interaction go a human’s
innate biological abilities to
acquire language, as well as
exposure in the environment in which
the child is developing.
This theory acknowledges that both
environmental and biological factors
are important in language
acquisition

                Three of the prominent names in forming
the interactionist approach were Lev
Vygotsky, Jerome Bruner and Jean Piaget.
Vygotsky was a Russian psychologist who
created a model of human development
which is now referred to as the
“sociocultural model”. He believed that
there is two distinct stages to cultural
development: when children observes
adult’s behaviour around them, and then
when they begin to interact and
participate in this behaviour.
Jerome Bruner believe that all humans
learn best when they discover knowledge
for themselves. He argues that This
takes place when babies and adults have
“conversations”, even before babies can
actually speak.
Jean Piaget was the psychologist who
first researched and proposed his theory
on cognitive development. He proposed
that children think and feel differently
to adults, and so develop their
cognitive skills over time accordingly.

                    <p>
One form of support for this theory is
that when children are raised in single
parent households are much more likely
to say the name of the parent they do
have (such as “mama” if raised by just
their mothers)
Another supporting factor is that when
children are very young, they can
recognise phonemes from languages all
over the world, but slowly lose this
ability and begin to only focus on the
phonemes in their own language as they
are exposed to it.

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                          One of the main criticism of this
theory is that children still learn to
speak, even when they come from
cultures that don't promote interaction
with babies. An example of this is in
Cameroon, where Nso babies are
constantly held looking out, rather
than at their mothers. This shows that
even though the babies don't really
interact with their caregiver, they
still learn to talk.
Another criticism is that many children
learn incorrect grammar and syntax,
even though they have interacted with
adults who do actually speak correctly.
