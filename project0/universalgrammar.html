                        The empiricist approach suggests that language depends on the environment and that language cannot be learnt without the environment.
                        Chomsky argues against the point above by pointing out a distinction in language. There is linguistic performance and linguistic competence. Linguistic competence is the knowledge of grammar within a language while linguistic performance is the application of this knowledge to acquire language.

                    <p>
                      Chomsky claims that the child's ability to acquire language is based on a knowledge of the universal grammatical principles that the child is born with.Chomsky states that human language relies on a knowledge of the structural  dependence of language. This approach to language that chomsky took is categorized as the rationalist approach to language acquisition.

                    <p>
                            The rationalist questions the empirical approach by questioning what the child hears. For example, in everyday language the child would hear false starts and only certain aspects of the language. In other words, the child would have an incomplete view on how the language works. The child should only be able to develop language based on an already understood principal of language structure.

                            The empiricist may argue against this by stating that the mother intervenes with this development. However, there are 3 main reasons why this rebuttal is weak. One, the mothers speech is based on questions, these questions are not reflected in the child's speech but rather responded to. Two, in some cultures the mother doesnâ€™t even speak with the child. Three, the speed and ease in which the child develops language would suggest that there is already a understanding of language
